                About Albert Einstein
            </h2>
            <p>Albert Einstein, a German-born physicist who developed the special and general theories of relativity and won the Nobel Prize for 
                Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, W√ºrttemberg, Germany, and 
                passed away on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey, in the United States. Most people agree that Einstein was the most 
                prominent physicist of the 20th century. He studied everything from motion and gravity theories to quantum mechanics. Upon the 
                release of a number of ground-breaking studies, Einstein traveled the globe and delivered presentations about his findings. 
                Several universities in Europe and America awarded Albert Einstein honorary doctorates in science, medicine, and philosophy.
                More than 150 non-scientific and more than 300 scientific works were published by Albert Einstein. He also wrote and commented 
                frequently on numerous philosophical and political issues. Because of his exceptional intelligence and creativity, "Einstein".

                <p>On March 14, 1951, Einstein's birthday, a photograph was shot that has been dubbed "probably one of the best recognized press 
                    photographs of any 20th century personality" by the Guardian. The scientist had been smiling the entire night as he left his 
                    72nd birthday party at Princeton University, which was overrun with photographers. Another mob of reporters and photographers 
                    moved forward as he left the gathering and got into the backseat of a car with Dr. Frank Aydelotte, the former director of the 
                    Center for Advanced Study at Princeton University, and Aydelotte's wife, Marie Jeanette. Einstein wasn't feeling well. 
                    He reportedly exclaimed, "That's enough!" Yet they paid no attention.Einstein stuck his tongue out at the audience out of 
                    frustration‚Äîand perhaps a little spite‚Äîthen quickly turned away.</p>
