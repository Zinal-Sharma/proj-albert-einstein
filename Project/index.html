                About Albert Einstein
            </h2>
            <p>Albert Einstein, a German-born physicist who developed the special and general theories of relativity and won the Nobel Prize for 
                Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Württemberg, Germany, and 
                died on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey, in the United States.The 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics was given to Einstein in 
                1922 "for his achievements to Theoretical Physics, and particularly for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect." 
                Einstein earned various accolades and prizes throughout his life. Since none of the 1921 candidates satisfied the standards 
                established by Alfred Nobel, the prize was carried over and given to Einstein in 1922.More than 150 non-scientific and more than 
                300 scientific works were published by Albert Einstein. He also wrote and commented frequently on numerous philosophical and 
                political issues. Because of his exceptional intelligence and creativity, "Einstein".

                <p>On March 14, 1951, Einstein's birthday, a photograph was shot that has been dubbed "probably one of the best recognized press 
                    photographs of any 20th century personality" by the Guardian. The scientist had been smiling the entire night as he left his 
                    72nd birthday party at Princeton University, which was overrun with photographers. Another mob of reporters and photographers 
                    moved forward as he left the gathering and got into the backseat of a car with Dr. Frank Aydelotte, the former director of the 
                    Center for Advanced Study at Princeton University, and Aydelotte's wife, Marie Jeanette. Einstein wasn't feeling well. 
                    He reportedly exclaimed, "That's enough!" Yet they paid no attention.Einstein stuck his tongue out at the audience out of 
                    frustration—and perhaps a little spite—then quickly turned away.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Before relocating to the United States in 1933, Albert Einstein resided in Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and Czechia 
                        (which was then a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When Albert was a little boy, his father gave him a compass, and Albert immediately fell in love with science.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Albert quit the grammar school he attended as a teenager at the age of 15 because he detested the stringent rules.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Nevertheless, at the age of 16, he wrote his first scholarly paper! His compass inspired the paper, which discussed the force of magnetism.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rather than directly becoming a physicist, Albert first trained as a teacher.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Albert decided to pursue a Ph.D. in physics after failing to find work as a math and physics teacher.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Albert announced his famous formula, E=mc2, in 1905 as one of his discoveries.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Albert's 'general theory of relativity,' which he worked on for the next ten years, included the formula.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Albert's theory of relativity aided scientists in understanding the workings of the universe.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In 1921, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.
